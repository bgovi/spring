The PDB directory contains modules for working with Proteins, DNA and RNA data from
pdb files.  The three modules used in this directory are the most commonly used
in Brandon Govindarajoo's framework.  The order of studying each module should 
be: pdbchains.py, alignment.py, and interface.py

pdbchains.py:
A module for reading, writing and manipulating pdb data.

alignment.py:
A module for sequence and structure alignment.

interface.py:
A set of functions for protein dimer complexes.  

NWalign:
Directory containing python wrappers for NWalign implemented
in fortran.

TMalign:
Directory containing python wrapper for TMalign implemented 
in c++.

TMscore
Directory cotaining python wrapper for TMscore implemented in
fortran
